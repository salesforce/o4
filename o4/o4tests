Descriptions of manual tests currently being done.

Writable file:
    rm -f .o4/changelist
    p4 sync filename#1
    chmod +w filename
    echo new >>filename
    o4 sync .      # Cannot use -f
    * INFO messages
    * exit status 0
    * .o4/changelist exists

These tests use two clientspecs; some of the steps are
required in case they're both being used from the same directory.
