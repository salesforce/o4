Descriptions of manual tests currently being done.

Writable file:
    rm -f .o4/changelist
    p4 sync filename#1
    chmod +w filename
    echo new >>filename
    o4 sync .
    * INFO messages
    * exit status 0
    * .o4/changelist exists


Resolve conflict
  client 1
     p4 edit f1
     modify line 1
  client 2
     p4 edit f1
     modify line 1 differently
     p4 submit
  client 1
     edit f2 # not opened
     # have to sync here in order to get "resolve skipped" on the next sync
     o4 sync .

  * f2 has the correct content







Questions
-----------
If there is an error in the first o4 pipeline, the parent exits, so
can still leave files unsynced that would have been synced by a later
pipeline. Would it be okay to continue on and exit with error if any
of the pipelines did?
